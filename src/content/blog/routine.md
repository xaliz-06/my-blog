Do you ever feel inexplicably helpless? Like a ghost living its own haunting? Like you're supposed to be someone, somewhere, but doomed to chase around? And it gnaws at you from within, like a parasitic insect with a thousand tiny teeth, chewing through your stomach lining, biting harder every time you try to think?

… Well, I don't feel that anymore.

<br>

Alarm blares on my phone lying next to my pillow. But I was already awake. It's 8:00 AM. I usually wake up a few minutes before my alarm does—maybe we both suck at our job. That's an amusing thought. But one that I don’t quite have the time to entertain.

I have a train to catch. That's usually the only idea that weighs inside my head in the morning after waking up. Is that the weight of repetition?… I don’t have time for introspection, my train leaves at 8:57.

It might seem I’m hurrying through my steps but I’m not. There’s no urgency, just habit. Why would I hurry? I have a systemic routine. It runs like clockwork. I wake, I move, I function—like a movie I’ve seen too many times. I know what happens next, and next and after that. Although, I do wonder if my name will be in the credits…

Before I could finish that thought, my toaster dings to remind me take out the hard-boiled eggs from the hot water. Like I said, I have a routine. On Tuesdays, I like my eggs with a creamy yolk. I don’t remember choosing that—It just became a habit. It’s 8:29 by the time I’m done with my breakfast and slipped into a faded grey shirt I’ve had since college. It’s not stylish but its clean and does the job. I spot a fresh bit of loose stitching on my old, square-toe shoes. That’s new, I suppose.

It’s a 3 minute walk to the nearest bus stop from my apartment. The bus arrived 6 minutes later than it usually does. That meant my usual journey to the train station would take a little longer today. Inside the bus, it was a little more crowded than I am used to. The second window seat from the back was occupied—a plump woman in office casuals sat there. I felt a faint tinge of disappointment. Maybe, without realizing, that seat became a part of my routine. I don’t like deviations from my habits. I stayed by the door. My stop comes quick enough anyway.

<br>

My attention shifts to a pair of kids sitting by the door, just a few feet from me. A boy and a girl, early twenties perhaps—not much younger than me. Both dressed in gaudy brand logos and accessories.

“… it’s not the worst thing in the world, but come on, I don’t deserve this,” the girl complained, the window’s amber light catching the clear skin of her cheek and making it faintly glow. She looked quite pretty, I suppose. “Anyways, me complaining doesn’t help” she added, her lips curling into a crooked twist that mimicked annoyance.

“I mean, it’s not like you’re getting peanuts now,” said the boy, lanky and animated, barely containing a giggle. His face reminded me that of a sloth. “Maybe it’ll finally motivate you to get your grades up,” he teased.

“Shut up. I’m not in the mood for your stupid jokes” she shot back, scowling at him.

“Okay, okay” he replied, paired with strange gestures with his hands—which I assume meant to ease her temper, though they seemed more irritating than disarming, at least to me. “How about we ditch lectures and go bowling? That always cheers you up.”

“I did that last Tuesday,” she muttered with a pout.

I can't remember what I did last Tuesday. I don't need to. I'll do it again today.

The boy said something else after that which I didn’t quite catch. If I had to guess, it would’ve been something embarrassingly sweet. But oddly, my mind wandered away, back to college. Not that I remember bowling or having a much of an allowance. Maybe I did go bowling once or twice—but that’s not the point.

I don’t believe I’ve changed all that much. I still read Terry Pratchett whenever I can. I still use the same toothpaste I picked up in my first year. Not to forget, I’m wearing a grey shirt I remember pulling off the sale rack in the campus thrift shop. I don’t think my personality’s changed either. I’ve always had the soul of an explorer—inquisitive and ambitious. That spark of ambition hasn’t gone out. Not really. I just shifted priorities. That’s what people do, I’m told.

Still, my explorer’s soul stumbles upon a rift which must’ve been too subtle to notice when it first began. Not carved by disorder, but by the quiet, uneventful erosion of time.

And I wondered why that strange thought had chosen now to visit me.

<br>

I got off at my stop at 8:47. The station’s a 12 minute walk from there—faster than staying on the bus, which takes a longer loop around before stopping near it anyway. I quicken my stride, not out of hustle but habit. Even at this pace I might miss the train. Then again, I’ll catch it tomorrow—and the day after, and the day after that. The same train, at the same time. I know the exact compartment I’ll sit in too. And, if Fletcher from PM&C and his clique of middle-aged jocks are a little late, I’ll get my favorite seat too—the one near the window on the left with the scratch on the cushion that looks like a lightning bolt. It’s in my routine. More so, a habit. Habits don’t care if I’m 5 minutes late.

My manager, Gerald, doesn't mind me showing up at work half an hour later even though my work hours begin at 9:30. He's a good man, empathetic and funny. Two weeks ago, when Riders won their 4th championship he threw a little party for all of us.

"Sorry about the final mate, God knows I'd be if I was a Saints fan," he said with a cocky chuckle and a sincere effort to sportingly rub it in my face. I was born in Silver Lake, but I don't care for my local team or sports. I told him that before but he always ignores—never leaving an opportunity for banter.

“You mustn’t let it get you down, ” he added, patting my back. At first, I didn’t catch his meaning. “There’s always next season,” he smiled.

There's a smile on his face that's almost feels... warm. He's divorced and lives alone in a single room apartment upstate. A few coworkers mentioned in hushed, sympathetic tones about seeing him at the bar, drinking until he could barely stand. So, that smile confuses me.

<br>

As I walked down the sidewalk, bright posters for summer collections hang from the flashy show-boards of stores. In the display of a clearly expensive boutique, I spot a blue-and-white polka-dotted sundress. Erica wore the same one last Sunday when we went to the movies. I can’t recall the name of the movie or the actors who starred in it. Some generic coming-of-age drama that insisted on the freedom of youth.

Actually, I don’t remember much of the night either. We dined at some place she picked, ordered what she suggested and ended up at my apartment. The rest of the night went by in a similar flurry.

Afterwards, she curled into me and said she felt stuck at her job. I made no comment. She kept ranting—about her monotonous job, a repetitive routine, a rude boss and a senior who always had a cringey one-liner ready. I let her speak, slowly moving my hand through her hair.

She worked as an assistant at an accounting firm I couldn’t remember the name of. I only know it’s nearby my office because she boards the same downtown train. I’d noticed her for weeks—a petite woman with a pear-shaped face, bright brown eyes and dusty auburn hair. Always dressed in that effortless casual-sophisticated way. It wasn’t until Friday that she finally spoke to me. She sat down beside me—my usual seat. I didn’t mind of course, but I did wonder why she chose to talk. I don’t think she’d noticed me before. Probably just chance.

Still, we chatted through the whole evening commute. She told me about her job, her friends, her dog, her family, the new salon she discovered, her recent dental procedure… it was impressive how she managed to sweep through so many tangents during our short journey. The next day, I saw her again on my way home. I sat down my usual seat, but she called out and asked me to join her in the vacant seat beside her. I hesitated for a moment, then moved.

We chatted again—or rather she did. I figured she must like talking. I slid in a few “yeahs”, “I suppose” and “you’re right”s where they seemed fit. She told me I was a good listener, then asked if I had plans for Sunday. I said I didn’t have any. So made one for us to which I said yes.

I woke up first the next morning and started about my routine. After brushing my teeth, I reached for the eggs— two at first, then four. Mondays meant soft, scrambled eggs. I paused for a moment, wondering if Erica liked scrambled eggs on Mondays. I didn’t know her routine.

I heard soft rustle of clothes from the bedroom as she got dressed. A few minutes later, she walked into the narrow hall that served as my kitchen. She greeted me casually, brushing her hair with a little comb. I asked if she’d like to shower but she politely declined.

“I think I’ll quit my job today,” she blurted, out of nowhere. “I need a vacation. Desperately.”

“What would you do after?” I asked, not really expecting an answer. That kind of question wasn’t part of my routine anyway.

“Maybe go live with my sister for a bit. Start a business of my own, I dunno,” she said, sliding into the seat across the table from me. Her tone sloppy, her face didn’t show any hint of uncertainty or fear. “Do you ever wish you were doing something else?” she asked, suddenly looking towards me.

“No” I replied, calmly. Is it lying if you’ve forgotten the answer?

I saw a speck of distaste in her eyes. “Oh,” she said, her voice dipping slightly. “You just don’t strike as someone content with his job.” I didn’t respond. Instead, I placed two plates on the table: scrambled eggs, toast, and a banana on each. I slid one plate toward her, then turned towards to the fridge for the milk.

“I prefer sunny-side-up, but thanks anyway,” she said, her eyes flickering with something like mild disappointment.

I almost felt offended at that. It shouldn’t have bothered me—but it did. It wasn’t her preference, but the disruption that unsettled me. What I felt at that moment stuck with me. I discovered that small deviations almost feel like intrusions to the monochromatic numbness around predictability I’ve built. Even a loose thread feels like unraveling.

She took her time with breakfast, speaking between bites, while I went through my routinely motions at the pace I was habituated to. She talked about being underpaid, then veered into how her friend Alyssa started her own jewelry business and now makes thrice as much as she used to.

“I just think if someone as dumb as Alyssa can do it, what’s stopping me?” she didn’t expect me to answer. Her face lit up as she continued. She didn’t seem like someone who thought her decisions through, certainly didn’t inspire clarity. Honestly, none of it sounded particularly convincing . But I kept those thoughts to myself. My morning routine nearly approached an end.

I told her she could stay longer if she wanted, but she caught the drift and began gathering her things. She didn’t stop talking the whole time—filling the silence with words that hardly mattered. Before leaving, she gave one last look to herself on the mirror near the wardrobe, and pressed a distracted peck to my cheek.

“I’ll call you later to tell you how it went,” she said with an infectious smile. “We should do this again.” I nodded and wished her luck.

I left my apartment at 8:36. But, the bus wasn’t late and I got the second window seat from the back. And I caught my train on time.

That was yesterday. Erica didn’t call. Not that I expected her to. Our patterns don’t match. And truthfully, it’d be a pain to mold a new routine that includes her.

<br>

I pass by the Stowe Building around the corner of New Station Avenue. It's a 6 minute walk to the station from here—8:52 on the watch. "I'm late," I think to myself, quickening my stride but a strange lack of panic hollowing my chest.

A few paces ahead, there’s the old, quaint cafe that’s served this blue-collar neighborhood for eight decades now. My older coworkers—those who grew up here—swear it hasn’t changed a bit from their childhood.

The little, open-fronted building has sun-peeled paint flaking off its walls with an outdoor patio scattered with mismatched tables and rusted chairs. Inside, a narrow room carries the comforting smell of garlic bread, punctuated by the booming laugh of an old, stout, pot-bellied man—the second-generation owner.

I’ve never been inside, but I pass it every morning.

I always see a handful of elderly men and women sitting around idly. Some engrossed in games, others locked in serious political debates as if their opinions mattered beyond the sidewalk. A group of wrinkled women sits in a circle gossiping and giggling. It’s the same scene everyday. Sometimes a new addition shows up. But no one does anything particularly remarkable.

At the far end of the patio, a trio of elderly men always sit at the lone square table. There’s Frank— the thin, slightly moldy-looking one— quietly folded behind the _Morning Times._ Beside him sits Donnie, short with weary eyes, and Grant, with a flowing white beard and a calm wise demeanor to him. A view I’m habituated to.

Over time, I’ve come to know bits and pieces about them. It began with simple little nods and gestures, then gradually, small talk slipped in between the few short minutes I linger by.

I learned that Frank’s daughter got married and moved abroad. Donnie, the shorter one, had his second hip surgery two months ago; the pain hasn’t stopped bothering, he says, like a nagging neighbor. And Grant—who always has a piece to say. A comment on the weather, a tidbit about the buildings in the neighborhood, a nostalgic gripe about how the cafe’s bagels were better in the 70s, or how the city’s lost its soul since his glory days.

Today, as I approached the cafe, I figured I wouldn’t have the time to stop by and greet the trio. I had little time to spare anyway. But my attention snagged on the peculiarly empty third chair at the square table. Only Frank and Donnie were there today. For a change, it was Frank who had sat aside his paper and joined Donnie for a game.

“Morning, gentlemen,” I said. “is Grant away?” I asked, knowing I was already delayed, but unable to resist my curiosity.

“Grant had a stroke yesterday,” Donnie replied in his usual raspy tone. “His son came and took the old boy to be buried at the family farm.”

“God rest his soul” added Frank, his eyes still fixated on the vintage board.

“I see” I responded, pausing a beat.

“You’re late today,” Donnie muttered, taking a sip of his black coffee. He seemed to be in the same relaxed, smug posture he always had during games with Grant. “Better hurry.”

I nodded and went on with my way towards the station at a swift pace.

I didn’t feel grief exactly—not in traditional sense. Grant’s demise didn’t hurt. Though I’d probably miss his quiet observations. What perturbed me was the ease of substitution—the effortless conformity to the anomaly of Frank, the silent reader, replacing Grant. No interlude for chaos to settle in. Just a quiet shifting of roles, as if the pattern had simply adjusted itself unceremoniously.

It wasn’t Grant’s absence that lingered with me as I ascended the stairs of the bustling station, weaving through the tumult of shouting buskers and jostling crowds. It was how seamlessly the routine healed, even evolved, without him. Buried beneath my reluctant reconciliation with predictability, was a flicker of envy. That they could break their patterns. That they could recalibrate their habits.

<br>

Sometimes I wonder if I’m hardwired to be who I am. It sounds vain— narcissistic even. I don’t remember when or how my programming started, only that the algorithm slowly etched itself into my fundamental reality through sheer repetition. The impervious safeguard I’ve built around myself doesn’t seem all that suffocating to me. Lately, I’ve begun to notice the thickness of these walls. Through tiny crannies and crevices, light leaks in, illluminating the soft cracks I’ve subliminally ignored.

Maybe I'm just existentially-spiralling. I do have a train to catch.

I make my way pacing through the long stretch of hallway, brimming with the familiar morning rush. The air inside has thickened and the harsh sunlight streaming through the skylights casts a blinding heat that leaves me slightly lightheaded. On the platform, the typical herd mills about, shifting restlessly for another day to their workstations.

The station clock reads 8:56. I’m a minute early.

Spotting a small gap on a creaking bench, I sit down on it and decide to wait.

I try to trace the origin of this numbness. At what point did I consent to it? I struggle to recall the last time I resisted—tried to break away from this apparent script. Habit is a loop I can’t escape, perhaps one I no longer want to. Even the thought of stepping into the forbidden unknown feels cumbersome. The idea of learning to adapt to whole new choices, unfamiliar rules, untested instincts—it doesn’t frighten me as much as it irritates me. Yet for the first time in a very long while, that unpleasantry inspires something unexpected: wonder.

The train slides into the station with its familiar honk. The doors screech open, inviting the crowd to funnel in. Seats vanish within moments. I rise to my feet, heart thudding louder than the pulsing noise in my ears, and let the doors close without me. The departure signal rings. The train pulls away, leaving an unfamiliar hush to settle in.

In the strangest way, I feel a quiet flutter of triumph.

Last night, I watched a short video on my phone—some guy with a watermelon testing how many rubber bands it can withstand. I misjudged the tipping point six or seven times before I gave up and let the video feed the static in my skull. The break came when I least expected it. The melon suddenly snapped into a mess of flesh-like fragments.

What is a habit, if not the past repeating itself until you either can’t—or won’t— learn from it? Like those old J-RPGs I used to play as a kid—you never really know which choice amongst the thousands, branches the path towards an alternate ending. Toward something undiscovered.

Maybe a single decision is enough to break the ouroboros.

But delusions are rarely immutable. My quiet defiance is viciously shattered, leaving me caught between the faint hope of freedom and the enduring pull of routine.

I realize then—the routine wasn’t a tool I wielded. It was the mold I was shaped into, designed to preserve my functioning. An anchor to ensure I’d never drift too far. The walls aren’t only around _me_. They’re around _everything_.

For some reason, my mind conjures an image of an old, decrepit bridge bearing the burden of responsibility for far too long. Just as it threatens to collapse into liberation, a hasty renovation rams its bolts tighter and slaps its joints together, and commands it to continue.

My routine does not appreciate my little rebellion.

And all it took was a careless glance at the digital display:

**NEXT TRAIN AT 9:02 AM**

I sit back down on the same rusted bench and try to find some novelty in the extra minutes of waiting.
